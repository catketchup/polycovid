It comes as a plugin to polybar. This is how i set it up

#+BEGIN_SRC
[module/covid]
type = custom/script
exec = ~/dotfiles/polybar/covid
interval = 1800
#+END_SRC

A fullscreen view

There are two crawlers i included. The first =covid= comes from a Chinese website. It sometimes updates slowly, though it's still faster than CDC. The second crawler =covid_us= comes from a website in the US so it's faster so i recommand that.
